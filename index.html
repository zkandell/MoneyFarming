        <p>I honestly don't know why you're still here. This game isn't fun. It's not tested, tuned, tweaked, or any other "t"s.</p>
        <p>It's just bad. Stop playing this. It takes more than just numbers going up to make a game fun, and I didn't do that.</p>
        <p>This was nothing more than an exercise in learning Javascript. So please, just close the tab and do something else.</p>
